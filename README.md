Visual Basic Exercises

Sentence Breaker - A quick and fun exercise using Visual Basic that identifies the Value of a Range in the 'User Sentence' and splits that value into an index. The user enters numeric values in the 'A' column. Once the button is pushed, the value in the 'B' column will populate with the corresponding index value of the User Sentence.

Choose your Story - The user enters a 'Choice' numeric value and based on the value of the choice, the Sub will run an If/Else Statement that pushes 1 of 5 distinct messages to the Message Bo.
